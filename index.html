                            the University of St. Thomas studying Computer Science and Philosophy. Computer Science runs in the family,
                            myself, my dad, and two of my brothers all work in the field. I always assumed that I could pick it up
                            quickly and during my first class I fell in love with it! Why Philosophy you ask? Philosophy has always
                            been an interest of mine, I love to ponder the questions it asks and the thinking it requires. It also is 
                            a good preparation for my other passion: law. <br/>
                            &emsp;Computer Science and Law do not seem related at first, but once you dive deeper they share more than you expect.
                            Both require attention to detail, creative thinking, and problem solving. How I think about computer science 
                            problems is the same as I think about about law issues. After college I am considering going to law school
                            at Notre Dame, the University of Minnesota, or Harvard School of Law. I have not completely decided if that is 
                            what I want to do, I may take a couple years to work in Computer Science and really gain a clear understanding
                            of the field.<br/>
                            &emsp;A few fun facts! I come from a big <a href="img/bielejeski family.jpg" target=_blank>family</a>, I am the 8th of 11 children. I currently have 20 nieces and nephews. They are a huge
                            blessing in my life. I enjoy playing tennis, reading science fiction, and playing Spikeball. I love to vacation in 
                            Florida, or anywhere on the ocean. One day I hope to travel to all 50 states, only 10 left to go!
