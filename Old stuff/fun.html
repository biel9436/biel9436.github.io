                <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    &emsp;Several months ago, an idea popped into my head, "What if I lived in an RV for a year and travelled
                    around the United States?" With that thought, this dream was born.<br/><br/>
                    
                    &emsp;My goal is to buy a mid-sized RV
                    and then travel the country, visiting every one of 48 contiguous states. Ideally my trip would last appoximately
                    one year. I would have about a week in every state, with a few extra here and there for the extra special 
                    places. The goal would be to time it right and end up in the best places for each season. Fall in the Northeast
                    and Midwest, Winter in the South, Spring and Summer somewhere nice. </br><br/>

                    &emsp;I think this idea came to me because of the new prevalence of remote work. My current job is remote, and 
                    I think most other jobs I can find will also be remote. As long as I have a good Internet connection, I
                    can work from anywhere in the world. Finding a good connection could be challenging, but I think something like
                    Starlink would be very useful for my trip. Finding places to park would be the most difficult part. I 
                    would probably rely heavily on both state and national parks. Another possibly cool idea would be to have
                    my friends join me throughout the year. It would be awesome to have someone fly out to visit me and travel
                    with me for a few weeks. Honestly, the more I talk about this, the more I actually want to do it!
